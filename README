NAME

  Cache::Cache

DESCRIPTION

  The Perl Cache package provides Cache::Cache, a generic interface
  for creating persistent data stores.  This interface is implemented
  by the Cache::FileCache, Cache::SizeAwareFileCache,
  Cache::MemoryCache, and Cache::SharedMemoryCache classes.  This work
  replaces File::Cache and IPC::Cache.

REQUIREMENTS

  Data::Dumper
  Digest::MD5
  File::Spec
  File::Path
  IPC::Shareable

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


USAGE

  see perldoc Cache::Cache, Cache::FileCache, etc, but in general it
  is a simple as:

    use Cache::FileCache;  # or Cache::MemoryCache, etc.

    my $cache = new Cache::FileCache( ), # or Cache::MemoryCache, etc.

    my $key = 'foo';

    my $original_object = 'bar';

    $cache->set( $key, $original_object );

    my $fetched_object = $cache->get( $key );


SEE ALSO

  File::Cache and IPC::Cache


NOTES

 * I am considering replacing Data::Dumper with Storable
